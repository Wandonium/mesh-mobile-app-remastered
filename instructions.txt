To successfully compile the app,

1. Use "yarn install" to install node_modules. Don't delete the existing lock file. 

2. You may have to change permission to the node_modules folder to avoid android build errors, in my case I just give them 777 permission.

3. Run "npm run patch:node_modules" to patch some files in node_modules.

4. Run "cd android; ./gradlew clean; cd .." to clean android build. 

5. Run "npm run build:android" to build android, do not use sudo otherwise Hermesc will return error 5. 

6. Go to ios folder, run "pod install".

7. Run "npm run patch:ios" to patch some Pod files, you may run into permission issue, just sudo it.

8. Run "npm run build:ios" to rebuild the jsbundle. 

9. Now the code should build in mesh.xcworkspace, should probably clean your build

To create a debug APK:

1. Run "yarn run clean:android" command.
2. Run "yarn run build:androidBundle" command.
3. Run "yarn run build:androidDebug" command.

All 3 scripts 'clean:android', 'build:androidBundle' & 'build:android:Debug' are in the package.json file.
